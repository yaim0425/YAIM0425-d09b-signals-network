# 📡 `zzzYAIM0425 0900 signals network`
This MOD allows you to **send circuit signals from anywhere to anywhere**, with no distance or surface restrictions, even across planets.

> 🧩 This MOD is part of the [series `zzzYAIM0425`](https://github.com/yaim0425), developed to provide modular enhancements and utilities that enrich the gameplay experience.  
> 🔧 It depends on [`zzzYAIM0425 0000 lib`](https://github.com/yaim0425/zzzYAIM0425-0000-lib), which is automatically managed by the system.  
> All content is available for anyone; I'm open to changes, corrections, and suggestions.
